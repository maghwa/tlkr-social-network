## Project Context

In June 2022, as part of our second-year cycle class preparatory projects, we embarked on a project to enrich our web programming skills. The result of this endeavor is the dynamic and interactive social networking website named "tlkr."

## Project Overview

"tlkr" was born as a web-based social networking site, aiming to provide real-time interaction within a community of internet users. 

### Project Features

Tlkr encompasses all the essential features for information sharing, including:

- Sending and receiving messages to and from users.
- Accessing a news feed containing all updates.
- Posting new updates.
- Liking and commenting on updates.
- Searching for members and listing them.
- Inviting internet users to join.
- Managing user accounts (editing, deleting).
- User registration, authentication, and logout functionality.


### Analysis and Design

This section covers the development stages of the site, provides information about the design, tools used, the environment, languages, and offers a comprehensive look at the project's design.

#### Tools Used

##### Languages & Frameworks

To bring tlkr to life, we utilized a range of languages and frameworks for both the frontend and backend:

**Frontend**:

- **HTML5**: The latest major revision of the HTML language, designed to represent web pages.
- **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS)**: Used for straightforward and effective web page styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility CSS framework that simplifies the creation of responsive and customized user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (React JS)**: A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building single-page web applications based on components and state changes.
- **Framer Motion**: A React.js animation library that streamlines animation creation.

**Backend**:

- **Firebase**: A Google service offering real-time NoSQL database hosting, social authentication (Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub), notifications, and various other services. It simplifies interactions with applications through an integrated library.

Firebase was the ideal choice for managing the database, user authentication, and various other aspects of Talker. It is particularly well-suited for real-time interactive web applications.

### Responsive Design
tlkr boasts a responsive design, ensuring that the site is accessible and user-friendly across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets. The responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience for all users.
